## About ExtentionPrintR

ExtPrint3r is an exploit created by [Blobby Boi](https://github.com/Blobby-Boi/) with the goal of being the successor to ExtHang3r, The old ExtentionStoppR was based on ExtHang3r, and now ExtentionPrintR is based off of ExtPrint3r, and is a proper fork! The exploit recreates the behavior of the LTMEAT Print method by flooding iframes and then printing the page. This is exactly what ExtPrint3r exploits, since it also works with extension pages (as long they are under web_accessible_resources). This seems to be much more consistent than the patched ExtentionStoppR ever was, and it also lasts for a longer period of time, Just like normal ExtPrint3r.
> It is heavily recommended that you disable the V8 optimizer (chrome://settings/content/v8) prior to using this exploit! This was found by [ts353](https://github.com/ts353).

makes ChromeOS forget that extentions should run, or think.
Based off of **ExtentionStoppR** and [ExtPrint3r](https://github.com/Blobby-Boi/ExtPrint3r).

# Instructions:

## Type 1: "NoJavBoot"

* Step 1: Pin the extention you want to disable

* Step 2: open the exploit like normal, follow along with its instructions and kill the extention

* Step 3: After checking it won't start, go back to the extention's page `chrome://extensions/?id=EXTENTIONID`, and click `Allow access to file URLs` twice.

* Step 4: Click on the extention you just pinned, if it doesn't load, continue to step 5, if it loads, press `Reload + Power Button` and retry the exploit from the start

* Step 4: If step 3 succeeds or the extention is no longer loading, stay on the page for the exploit, click the extention, and quickly press `esc + Reload + Power Button `

* Step 5: Whenever you reach the recovery page, press ` Reload + Power Button ` within 10 seconds.

* Step 6: Once you are signed in, Make sure you have NO TABS OPEN except chrome://newtab.

* Step 7: Click on your extention 1-3 times, see if it says it's disabled, or javascript isn't working. If it does continue to step 8, if it doesn't, retry the exploit.

* Step 8: Ta-da! You just found out how bad ChromeOS is.

*Type 1 has only been tested with the extention Linewise (CRX), if it doesnt work on another extention, create a pull request or submit an issue :D*
